title:  Week 11 | Halfway Point Update
---

So far in our group project we’ve been able to make great progress in terms of interacting with the community! We’ve been able to make various types of contributions and have also learned a lot. In the next few weeks of the semester, we hope to make even more contributions that will have a lasting effect on the project!

Specifically, we want to start trying to work on one bigger contribution instead of a bunch of smaller ones. That being said, this may be difficult to accomplish since the maintainer of the project unfortunately never responded to our email, so we’ll need to try to find or purpose some of our ideas via the discussion board.

In addition to a bigger contribution to the project, we also want to continue contributing new icons to the project to help expand the options that users have when using Lucide!

## The Presentation

I really enjoyed the presentation from Shivam Balikondwar! It was a great story about how he got into open source development and how it has benefited him. The projects that he has contributed to seem quite complicated, so it was interesting to see how he was able to overcome all of the obstacles that he talked about.

Another interesting thing about the presentation was how he was able to use his contributions to projects to grow his network. This is something that I don’t think many people talk about, but making contributions to a project can be a great way to start a conversation with interesting people which can then lead to a great beneficial relationship that could lead to other opportunities!
