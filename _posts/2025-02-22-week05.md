title: Week 5 - Diving Head First Into Open Source
---

There are some really cool projects in the world of open source software that would be great to contribute to. This blog post goes over some of the projects that interest me most, the challenges that come with contributing to them, and how I’ll overcome them.

## Different types of projects

There are so many open source projects, all of which have their own communities and cultures. A lot of the culture is set from the top-down via the core creators, but it can also be partially influenced by the culture of whatever language the project is written in. 

There are also some projects that are a lot more active than others and some that have more friendly environments / are open to new contributors. One example of a project with a large and active community around it is [FastAPI](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi). From what I’ve seen, the community seems very welcoming and there is plenty of excellent documentation to help get new contributors up and running!

Some other projects that I have looked at just don’t have that same type of energy or community around it. There are a lot of projects out there that are mainly held together by one main contributor. Don’t get me wrong, they can still be great projects, but in terms of contributing to them, it seems like a much harder task, since I’ve seen a lot without information about contributing or good examples about past contributions to go off of.

## What interests me in open source

I’m most interested in contributing to projects in the open source community that I already use. Packages such as [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [AIOHTTP](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/), which I’ve already been able to make a small contribution to. 

Additionally, when looking for projects to contribute too, I think it’s important to find ones with positive contributors who are welcoming to new developers. Having an active community is also important as it’s much better to be able to get quick feedback on your contributions as opposed to creating a PR and then having to wait weeks or months until it gets comments on it.

## Biggest challenges

As mentioned above, one of the projects that I’m interested in contributing to is [AIOHTTP](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/). This is a popular Asynchronous HTTP client for Python that I use a lot. It’s a great package, and since I like the Asynchronous parts of Python, I find myself using it a lot.

Part of the reason why it’s a great package is because it’s **fast** and **reliable**. By no fault of anyone, this means that the code base is also quite complex. Since I want to try to contribute more to this project and because I'm just interested in how it works, I spent some time reading through the codebase and creating a diagram of how all of the main objects interact with each other.

Below is that diagram. It’s a flow chart of the main objects that are used when sending a simple `GET` request to a website:

Drawing this out and reading through the code, gave me a much better understanding of how the project works. I’m sure this will be helpful if I see more things that I can contribute to the project, but it was also a great exercise to see how some well-built software works.

By taking a step back and first understanding how an open source project works at a high level, I think I should be able to contribute to some of the more popular projects I mentioned in the post.
