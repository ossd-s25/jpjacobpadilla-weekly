title:  Week 14 | Thoughts on the First Round of Presentations
---

This Wednesday, we listened to three presentations showcasing the open source work that other groups have been doing. Each project offered unique insights, which I’ll share below.

## Preswald

Preswald was probably the most interesting project presented this week. It’s a YC-backed startup building a SaaS product for data scientists. They’re aiming to be a modern alternative to Streamlit, with sleek designs and support for a wide variety of graphs.

This project is likely the newest among the group—it’s only a few months old. Because of that, the group mentioned how quickly things were evolving. From their experience, this was both a benefit and a challenge.

The benefit was that there was a lot to do. They were able to meet with the founders directly and build full features into the product.

The challenge was that, as a newer project, documentation wasn’t always accurate or complete, which made collaboration more difficult. However, they turned this into a positive by contributing new documentation to help others get started more easily.

## Hugging Face

The Hugging Face project was also fascinating. The team made some impressive contributions—many of which were quite technical and went over my head. Given how complex the Hugging Face codebase is, it’s especially impressive that they were able to dive in and contribute meaningful changes.
