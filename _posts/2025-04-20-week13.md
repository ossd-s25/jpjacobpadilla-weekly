title:  Week 13 | Open Source As A Business Model
---

There are four main ways that open-source projects use to make money. Some projects were made with the goal of making money, while others have turned to one of these revenue streams just to get some extra money for their core contributors. Either way, in this post I’m going to explain what each of these revenue streams are and give a few examples of open source projects that are using them.

## 1) Open Core

The first popular business model to talk about is where an open-source project makes the core parts of their project available to anyone for free, but then lets you pay money for extra features. There are many businesses that use this approach since you can get someone “in the door” with a free open-source offering and then later have them pay for more useful features. Here are two projects that come to mind who use this approach to make money:

#### Redis

The open-source version gives you a fast, in-memory data store, but if you want advanced features like Redis modules, enterprise-grade security, or high availability clustering, Redis Labs offers a paid version with all of that built in.

#### WordPress marketplace

Another example is WordPress. While the core is free and open, the plugin and theme ecosystem is huge and many of those plugins cost money. Developers build paid themes or premium plugins that extend what WordPress can do, and that’s how they earn revenue.

## 2) Hosted service 

The second popular method for open-source projects to make money is by offering a hosted service. There are many projects such as WordPress, that, while technically free, require a server up and running 24/7 to actually use in a real-world setting. Not everyone wants to deal with setup, hosting, backups, performance tuning, or security updates. That’s where the hosted version comes in. The open-source software stays free, but the company offers a full serviced solution that’s easy to set up and get started with.

## 3) Enterprise support

The third common way that open-source projects make money is by selling support to companies who use their project. This makes a lot of sense, since a company who relies on a project would definitely be willing to pay a lot of money every month to make sure that they have someone to contact if there are any issues.

Two open-source projects that come to mind who make money from this approach are Red Hat and SQLite. According to the SQLite website, you can buy technical support from the maintainers themselves for between $8K–$85K a year!

## 4) Sponsorships / Ads / Donations

The last method I want to touch on is sponsorships, ads, and donations. This is what a lot of smaller projects use to get some extra money to pay contributors or to help justify them spending time on the project. There are a few companies that I see supporting this transaction of money:

#### Carbon Ads

Carbon Ads seem to be the go-to ad provider for open-source projects’ websites and their documentation. The ads are usually small, clean, and developer-focused – so they don’t feel out of place. You’ve probably seen them in sidebars on docs sites or dev blogs.

#### Buy Me A Coffee

This one's super lightweight – you just link to your page and people can throw you a few bucks if they find your project helpful. It’s more casual than Patreon and works well for solo devs or small tools.

#### Open Collective

Open Collective is a more structured and public approach to set up sponsorships/donations for open source projects. The platform lets people and companies donate to your project, and all the money and expenses are visible. It's used by a lot of community-driven projects, and it’s especially helpful when you have multiple maintainers or want transparency.

#### GitHub Sponsors

One of the most common and easiest ways that open source projects get donations is by accepting donations through GitHub sponsors. Sponsors can support you monthly, and GitHub doesn’t take a cut. It also makes it easy for companies to sponsor projects directly through the platform they’re already using.

## Conclusion

From what I've seen, these four models are the core approaches that most open source projects use to generate money. Each project may put their own twist on these approaches, but they all come back to these. At the end of the day, it can be pretty hard monetizing a project that you’ve let everyone use for free, but luckily there are a few ways for them to make money!
