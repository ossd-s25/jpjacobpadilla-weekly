title: Week 6 - Recent Open Source Contributions
---

So far, I’ve contributed to a few interesting projects that I use regularly such as [AIOHTTP](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/) and [crawler-user-agents](https://github.com/monperrus/crawler-user-agents) for web scraping. However, this past week, I was able to help contribute to [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) via this [issue](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/issues/13400#issuecomment-2686580076)!

During my first blog post, I actually said that FastAPI was one of the projects that I thought would be fun to contribute too, but I wasn’t sure if it would actually be possible since it’s a very popular package and there aren’t many “easy” issues. That being said, a few days ago, I was reading through the recent issues and found one that seemed quite interesting.

### The Issue

The issue, which is a bug, has to do with FastAPIs auto documentation feature (which is pretty amazing). The issue occurs when you try to mix multiple methods of defining HTTP headers in an API request. Instead of all of the headers showing up correctly (one by one in the documentation), they kind of got clumped together…

### Investigation

Being curious to see how hard it would be to fix this bug, I decided to fork FastAPI and start looking through the codebase. I was able to set up the development environment pretty quickly, thanks to UV. Luckily, the poster of the issue gave some simple code to recreate the bug, so I was also able to view said bug on my computer easily. 

Before looking into this issue, I had no idea how the documentation was auto-generated. So, I started by looking at the documentation’s source code in the browser to see if the documentation was sent from the server via one big HTML file, or if there was an internal API for the documentation.

As you can see from the above screenshot that I took, no documentation is sent via the initial HTML. All of it is sent via the openapi endpoint and loaded dynamically.

I then needed to figure out how the JSON that was being sent to the client was being generated via FastAPI. To do this, I used some command-f’ing and the PyCharm debugger to step through the code. This led me to this function:

This code basically creates the openapi api endpoint which returns a `JSONResponse` of the openapi schema. From this, I was able to read through the code and find the bug.

### The Solution

By looking through the code and doing a bunch of extra testing, I was able to find a relatively simple solution to the bug! I created a pull request for the issue, but as of writing this, it hasn’t been merged in yet. However, this is completely understandable since FastAPI is a mature project and you wouldn’t want to randomly throw in a bunch of unvetted code into the project.

### Final Thoughts

Making a contribution to FastAPI (even if the PR doesn’t end up getting merged) was a fun exercise in being able to understand a large codebase. FastAPI is a great package that I’ve been trying to find excuses to use more and more and finally taking a deeper look into the documentation portion of the codebase gave me a new insight into how it works!
